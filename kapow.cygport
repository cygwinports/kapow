SUMMARY="Qt punch clock program"
DESCRIPTION="Kapow is a punch clock program designed to easily keep track of
your hours, whether youâ€™re working on one project or many. Simply clock in and
out with the Start/Stop button. If you make a mistake in your hours, you can go
back and edit any of the entries by double-clicking on the session in question.
Kapow also allows you to easily keep track of the hours since you last billed
a client."
